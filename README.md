## Motivation
Riyadh is a rapidly growing city with a rich food life, and it boasts many restaurants offering a variety of cuisines for a variety of tastes and predilections. With such a plethora of restaurants, the selection of an apt restaurant proves to be a challenging one for both its citizens and visitors.  

This project aims to address such a challenge through recommendation using data in a bid to allow users to find the best restaurants based on preference. By processing key factors such as type of food, rating, review, price range, and service options, one can build an insightful recommendation system that simplifies decision difficulty.  

### **Why This Problem?**  
1. **Personalized Restaurant Experience** – Users will face difficulty in selecting restaurants according to their budget, preference, and dining needs. An insightful recommendation system can contribute a lot towards a positive experience.  
2. **Time-Saving** – Users don't have to scroll through lengthy lists of restaurants but can receive personalized recommendations based on their likings.  
3. **Business Insights** – Restaurant owners can make significant observations regarding customer choices and make service improvements in relation to them.  
4. **Tourism Promotion** – Visitors in Riyadh can simply search for restaurants with high ratings and no re-testing and testing is involved.
